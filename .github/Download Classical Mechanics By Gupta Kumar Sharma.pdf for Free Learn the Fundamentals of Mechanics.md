In this article, we will review some of the main topics and concepts covered in the book Classical Mechanics By Gupta Kumar Sharma.pdf. We will also provide some examples and exercises to illustrate the applications and challenges of classical mechanics.
 
## Newton's Laws of Motion
 
The book begins with a review of Newton's laws of motion, which are the foundation of classical mechanics. Newton's laws of motion state that:

1. A body at rest or in uniform motion remains in that state unless acted upon by an external force.
2. The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the net external force acting on it and is in the same direction as the force.
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Using Newton's laws of motion, we can analyze the motion of various systems of particles and rigid bodies under different forces and constraints. For example, we can study the motion of a projectile under gravity, the motion of a pendulum under tension, or the motion of a planet under gravitational attraction.
 
## Conservation Laws
 
The book also discusses the conservation laws that arise from the symmetry and invariance properties of physical systems. Conservation laws state that certain quantities remain constant during the motion of a system, regardless of the external forces or interactions. Some of the important conservation laws are:

- Conservation of mass: The total mass of a system remains constant.
- Conservation of energy: The total energy of a system remains constant.
- Conservation of momentum: The total momentum of a system remains constant.
- Conservation of angular momentum: The total angular momentum of a system remains constant.

Using conservation laws, we can simplify the analysis of complex systems and find conserved quantities that can help us solve equations of motion. For example, we can use conservation of energy to find the speed of a roller coaster at different points along its track, or use conservation of angular momentum to find the precession rate of a spinning top.
