Dwarf Fortress is a complex and challenging simulation game that lets you create and manage a fantasy world. You can build a fortress, explore the wilderness, fight enemies, craft items, and much more. However, Dwarf Fortress can also be intimidating for new players, as it has a steep learning curve and a minimalistic graphics style.
 
That's why many fans of the game use the Starter Pack, a bundle of community-made enhancements that make Dwarf Fortress more accessible and enjoyable. The Starter Pack includes graphics packs, tools, bugfixes, tutorials, and other features that improve the game experience. One of the most popular versions of the Starter Pack is PeridexisErrant's Starter Pack[^1^], which is updated regularly to match the latest version of Dwarf Fortress.

## Step 1: Download the Starter Pack
 
The first step is to download the Starter Pack from the official download page on DFFD[^1^]. You can also use this tool[^1^] and the checksum on DFFD to confirm that you got an uncorrupted file. The file size is about 326 MB and it is in ZIP format.
 
## Step 2: Unzip the Folder
 
The next step is to unzip the folder using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can extract it to any location on your PC, but make sure that it is not in a "Program Files" folder, as the pack needs to be able to read/write files. The pack is a bundle of portable apps, so there is no further installation procedure.
 
## Step 3: [Optional]: Upgrade from an Earlier Release
 
If you have used an earlier release of the Starter Pack, you can upgrade by copying your old 'Dwarf Fortress 0.xx.yy/data/save/' folder to the new pack. This will preserve your save files and settings. However, do not try to upgrade by extracting or copying over an earlier pack, as this may cause errors or conflicts.
 
## Step 4: [Optional]: Visit the DF Wiki or Tutorials for Help
 
If you are new to Dwarf Fortress or need some guidance on how to play, you can visit the DF wiki or PeridexisErrant's tutorials[^1^] for help. The wiki has a lot of information and tips on various aspects of the game, while the tutorials are video series that explain the basics and advanced features of Dwarf Fortress.
 
## Step 5: Run PyLNP.exe and Enjoy!
 
The final step is to run PyLNP.exe, which is the launcher for the Starter Pack. You can use it to customize your graphics pack, sound pack, utilities, keybindings, mods, and other options. You can also use it to launch Dwarf Fortress or any of the included tools. Once you are ready, click on "Play Dwarf Fortress" and enjoy!
