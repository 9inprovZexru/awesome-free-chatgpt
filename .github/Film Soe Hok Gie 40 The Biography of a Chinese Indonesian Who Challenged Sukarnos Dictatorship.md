Soe Hok Gie's life was tragically cut short by a fatal accident on Mount Semeru, the highest peak in Java. He and his friends were hiking up the volcano as part of their passion for nature and adventure. However, they were unaware of the danger of inhaling the toxic gas that emanated from the crater.
 
According to some sources, Soe Hok Gie and his companions reached the summit of Semeru on December 16, 1969, one day before his 27th birthday. They were planning to celebrate his birthday on the mountain. However, they soon felt the effects of the gas poisoning, such as nausea, dizziness and hallucinations. Some of them managed to descend to a lower altitude, but Soe Hok Gie stayed behind to wait for his friend Herman Lantang, who was lagging behind.
 
Unfortunately, Herman never made it to the top. He collapsed on the way and was later found dead by a rescue team. Soe Hok Gie also succumbed to the gas and died on the summit. His body was discovered by another group of hikers who happened to pass by. They reported his death to the authorities and helped to transport his body down the mountain.
 
Soe Hok Gie's death was mourned by many people who admired his courage and idealism. He was buried in Jakarta with full honors and respect. His diary, titled Catatan Seorang Demonstran (Notes of a Demonstrator), was published posthumously and became a source of inspiration for many young Indonesians who aspire to follow his footsteps.
  
Download Film Soe Hok Gie 40 is not only a tribute to an Indonesian activist, but also a reminder of the beauty and the peril of nature. Mount Semeru is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, and also one of the most popular destinations for hikers and climbers. However, it also poses a serious risk for those who venture too close to its crater, where deadly gas can accumulate and erupt without warning.
