Maqbool is a dark and gripping story of ambition, betrayal, guilt and fate. It follows the rise and fall of Maqbool (Irrfan Khan), the right-hand man of Jahangir Khan (Pankaj Kapur), a powerful underworld don. Maqbool is secretly in love with Nimmi (Tabu), Jahangir's mistress, who persuades him to kill Jahangir and take over as the new don. Maqbool succeeds in his plan, but soon faces the consequences of his actions, as he is haunted by Jahangir's ghost and tormented by his own conscience. He also has to deal with the suspicion and rivalry of other gang members, as well as the investigation of two corrupt policemen (Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri), who had predicted his rise to power.
 
The film is a brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, retaining the essence and themes of the original play, while giving it a contemporary and realistic twist. The film showcases the talent and versatility of Vishal Bhardwaj, who not only directed the film, but also wrote the screenplay, dialogues and music. The film also features some of the finest performances by Indian actors, especially Pankaj Kapur, who won several awards for his portrayal of Jahangir Khan. The film also has a stunning cinematography by Hemant Chaturvedi, who captures the mood and atmosphere of the Mumbai underworld with his camera.
 
Maqbool is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates good cinema and literature. It is a rare example of a successful adaptation that does justice to both the source material and the medium. It is a film that will stay with you long after you finish watching it.
