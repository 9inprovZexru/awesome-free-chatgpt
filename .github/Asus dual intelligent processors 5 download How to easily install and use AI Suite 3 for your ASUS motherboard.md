- **TPU**: This feature allows you to manually adjust the CPU frequency, CPU cache, core frequencies, DRAM frequency, and related voltages for an enhanced system stability and a performance boost. You can also use the CPU Strap option to adjust the CPU Strap's BCLK frequency. You can save your overclocking settings as a TPU profile and load it manually after system bootup.
- **EPU**: This feature is a real-time system power-saving chip that automatically detects the current system loading and intelligently moderates power usage. It offers a total system-wide energy optimization, reduces fan noise, and extends the lifespan of your hardware components. You can choose from four preset modes: Auto, High Performance, Max Power Saving, and Away Mode. You can also enable Configured Max CPU Power for advanced energy saving condition.
- **DIGI+ Power Control**: This feature allows you to adjust the CPU and DRAM power phases for improved stability and efficiency. You can also enable Load-line Calibration to prevent voltage droop when increasing CPU load.
- **Fan Xpert**: This feature allows you to control the fan speed and noise level of your system. You can choose from four preset modes: Standard, Silent, Turbo, or Full Speed. You can also use the Fan Tuning option to scan and detect all fan characteristics for an optimized fan control curve.
