# How to Hack Any Minecraft Server with ForceOP
 
Minecraft is a popular sandbox game that lets you create and explore a virtual world made of blocks. You can play on different servers with different game modes, such as survival, creative, adventure, or mini-games. But what if you want to have more control over the server and its settings? What if you want to be an operator (op) and have access to all the commands and permissions?

That's where force op hack tools come in. These are programs or mods that can exploit a vulnerability in the Minecraft server software and give you op privileges without the consent of the server owner. With force op, you can do anything you want on the server, such as ban other players, change the game mode, spawn items, teleport, fly, and more. You can also unban yourself if you get banned by another op.
 
However, force op hack tools are not easy to find or use. They are often detected by anti-cheat plugins or antivirus software, and they can get you banned from the server or even from Minecraft itself. They can also harm your computer or expose your personal information to hackers. Therefore, you should be very careful when using force op hack tools and only download them from trusted sources.
 
In this article, we will show you some of the best force op hack tools that work for Minecraft 1.16.5/1.17 and how to use them safely and effectively.
  
## Wurst 7.0 - ForceOP, All Versions Supported
 
Wurst 7.0 is a hacked client for Minecraft that has many features, including force op. It works by running in a separate process and exploiting a vulnerability in the Minecraft server software. It supports all versions of Minecraft from 1.14.2 to 20w08a.
 
To use Wurst 7.0 for force op, you need to download it from [here](https://www.wurstclient.net/updates/wurst-7-0/) [^1^] and install it using Fabric. Then, you need to get the server's IP address and port number using [getip.com](https://getip.com/). Next, you need to choose the server type (vanilla, bukkit, or modded) and check the tasks you want to complete on the server (such as op yourself, unban yourself, etc.). Finally, you need to click start and wait for the force op window to appear.
 
Wurst 7.0 is one of the most reliable and updated force op hack tools available, but it also has some drawbacks. It can be detected by some anti-cheat plugins or antivirus software, and it can cause lag or crashes on some servers. It also requires Fabric to run, which can be incompatible with some mods or shader packs.

This is another force op hack tool that works for Minecraft 1.9.X and 1.8.X. It claims to work on all servers whether they are vanilla, bukkit, or modded. It does not require Fabric or any other mod loader to run.
