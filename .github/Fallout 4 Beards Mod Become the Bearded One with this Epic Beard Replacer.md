    - [Free the Beards](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20581/): This mod fixes the issue of disappearing beards when wearing certain headgear, such as helmets or masks. The mod is compatible with other facial hair mods and works with both male and female characters.
    - [The Bearded One](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/50788/): This mod adds a new beard style for male characters, inspired by Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series. The mod is high-quality and realistic, and comes with different color options.
