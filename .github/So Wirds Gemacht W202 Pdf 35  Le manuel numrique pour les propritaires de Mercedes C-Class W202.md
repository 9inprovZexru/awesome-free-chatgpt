If you want to learn how to repair and maintain your Mercedes C-Class W 202, "So wird's gemacht" is a great resource that will help you save money and time. However, you should always follow the instructions carefully and use the appropriate tools and parts.

However, "So wird's gemacht" also has some limitations that you should be aware of. First of all, the book is not updated for the latest models and technologies. Some of the information might be outdated or inaccurate for newer versions of the car. Secondly, the book does not cover every possible situation and scenario. Some repairs might require special equipment or skills that are not explained in the book. Thirdly, the book does not guarantee that you will be able to fix your car successfully. You should always use your own judgment and discretion when following the instructions.
