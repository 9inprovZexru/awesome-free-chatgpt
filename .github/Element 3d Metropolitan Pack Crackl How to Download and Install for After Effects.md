However, the Metropolitan Pack is not cheap. It costs $124.95 on the official Video Copilot website, which may be too expensive for some users. Fortunately, there is a way to download and install the Metropolitan Pack for free, using a cracked version of Element 3D. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## Step 1: Download Element 3D 2.2.3 (2192) from FileCR
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the latest version of Element 3D from FileCR, which is a website that provides free software downloads. The version we are using is 2.2.3 (2192), which was released on December 6, 2021[^1^]. This version has many features and improvements, such as group symmetry creation mode, matte reflection mode, matte shadow with alpha channel, and improved C4D support file support with animation.

Then, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on one of the download buttons.
