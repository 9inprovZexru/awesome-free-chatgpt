## Method 2: Using the Default IP Address
 
You can also use the default IP address of your router to access its web-based management page and perform firmware updates. Here is how to do it:

1. Connect your computer to the router's Wi-Fi network (or connect the computer to the router's LAN port using an Ethernet cable). In the browser address bar, enter the default IP address and log in to the router's web-based management page (check the nameplate at the bottom of the router for the default IP address). For routers that feature self-adaptive ports, you do not need to distinguish between WAN and LAN ports.
2. Go to More Functions > Manage Updates. Select whether you want to update automatically or perform a manual online update.
