# How to Use Cadence Incisive Enterprise Simulator for Functional Safety Verification
 
Cadence Incisive Enterprise Simulator (IES) is a powerful tool for verifying complex digital designs in SystemC, VHDL, Verilog, and mixed-signal environments. It supports a wide range of verification methodologies, including UVM, e, and assertion-based verification. But did you know that IES also has a functional safety simulator that can help you comply with the functional safety requirements of automotive and industrial applications?

In this article, we will show you how to use the Cadence Incisive Functional Safety Simulator (IFSS) to automate the process of fault injection and fault analysis for your designs. We will also explain how IFSS works with the Cadence vManager platform to provide comprehensive functional safety coverage reports. By using IFSS, you can save time and effort in verifying the functional safety of your designs and achieve faster certification.
 
## What is Functional Safety and Why is it Important?
 
Functional safety is the ability of a system or component to perform its intended function without causing unacceptable harm to people, property, or the environment. Functional safety is especially important for applications that involve human lives or critical infrastructure, such as automotive, aerospace, medical, industrial, and nuclear systems.
 
To ensure functional safety, designers need to identify and mitigate the potential hazards and risks that could arise from failures or malfunctions of their systems or components. These failures or malfunctions could be caused by random hardware faults, software bugs, environmental conditions, human errors, or malicious attacks.
 
One of the most widely used standards for functional safety is ISO 26262, which defines the requirements and processes for developing and verifying automotive electronic systems. ISO 26262 specifies four levels of Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL), from A to D, with D being the most stringent. Depending on the ASIL level of a system or component, designers need to achieve a certain level of fault detection and fault tolerance.
 
## What is Fault Injection and Fault Analysis?
 
Fault injection is a technique for simulating the effects of faults on a system or component under test. Fault injection can be performed at different levels of abstraction, such as gate-level, RTL-level, or system-level. Fault injection can also simulate different types of faults, such as stuck-at-0/stuck-at-1, single event upset (SEU), single event transient (SET), or bit-flip.
 
Fault analysis is a technique for evaluating the impact of faults on a system or component under test. Fault analysis can measure various metrics, such as fault activation probability, fault propagation probability, fault detection probability, fault masking probability, fault latency, and fault coverage. Fault analysis can also identify critical faults that could lead to hazardous or erroneous outcomes.

Fault injection and fault analysis are essential for verifying the functional safety of a system or component under test. They can help designers to assess the robustness and reliability of their designs against random hardware faults. They can also help designers to verify that their designs meet the functional safety requirements and achieve the target ASIL level.
 
## How to Use Cadence Incisive Functional Safety Simulator?
 
Cadence Incisive Functional Safety Simulator (IFSS) is a part of the Cadence functional safety solution that automates the process of fault injection and fault analysis for digital designs. IFSS operates within the IES compiled-code engine and provides seamless reuse of functional and mixed-signal verification environments[^1^].
 
To use IFSS, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Prepare your design under test (DUT) and your verification environment (testbench) as usual.
2. Specify your fault model and fault list using an XML file or an API call. You can define various attributes for each fault, such as type, location, duration, activation condition, etc.
3. Run IFSS with your DUT, testbench, fault model, and fault list as inputs. IFSS will automatically inject faults into your DUT during simulation and collect fault analysis data.
4. Analyze your fault simulation results using the Cadence vManager platform[^1^]. vManager provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to view various functional safety metrics and reports. You can also filter, 8cf37b1e13
