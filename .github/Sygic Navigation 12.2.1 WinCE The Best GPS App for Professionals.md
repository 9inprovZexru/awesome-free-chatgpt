## How to Install Sygic Navigation 12.2.1 WinCE
 
The installation of Sygic Navigation 12.2.1 WinCE consists of three steps:

1. Prepare installation image
2. Copy image to device
3. Invoke navigation on device

### Step 1: Prepare Installation Image
 
The installation image is a folder structure that contains the navigation software, maps and license file. You need to construct it locally on your computer by merging the contents of the two packages and a license file that you downloaded.
 
The navigation+sdk package with its subfolder Navigation/Sygic2D fills the Drive and Res folders. You also need to place .apk in the root.
 
The content of the map package needs to be copied inside the Maps folder, which should be cleaned up before if e.g. populated with demo maps.
 
As the last step, the license file (mlm file) needs to be copied inside the Maps folder.

### Step 2: Copy Image to Device
 
The next step is to copy the image to an appropriate place on sdcard or internal memory of your device. Typically, the image is copied to the device's root folder as follows (example with sdcard):

    sdcard\
    Drive\
    Res\
    Maps\

Alternatively, it can be placed inside a wrapping folder and moved into an arbitrary location, example Sygic2D:

    sdcard\
    Sygic2D\
    Drive\
    Res\
    Maps\

Please note that positioning of the Sygic software in the device's file system is subject to device's configuration capabilities as well as your requirements for application invocation.
 
### Step 3: Invoke Navigation on Device
 
The last step is to start Drive.exe application, which is on one of the following paths depending on your platform:

- ../Drive/WindowsCE/Drive.exe
- ../Drive/WindowsMobile/Drive.exe
- ../Drive/WindowsXP/Drive.exe
- ../Drive/Windows8/Drive.exe

The invocation of the application can be done in several ways:

- clicking on Drive.exe file in OS shell or through File Manager
- filling the Drive.exe full path in a device configuration. Then typically power off an on the device for auto start.
- alternatively there is often a special GUI button to trigger the application by means of a call from another program
