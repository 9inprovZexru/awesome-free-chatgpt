This makes it easier to achieve a smooth and natural compression without artifacts.
  
Another great dynamics plugin in MAudioPlugins is MSaturatorMB. This is a multiband saturator that can add warmth, color, and distortion to your sound. You can split the frequency spectrum into up to six bands and apply different types of saturation to each band.

MSaturatorMB has a built-in limiter and a dry/wet control for parallel processing.
  
## Equalization
  
Equalization plugins are essential for shaping the frequency balance and tone of your audio signals. They can also correct or enhance specific frequency ranges or remove unwanted noises. MAudioPlugins offer a wide range of equalization plugins, from basic filters and graphic EQs to advanced parametric EQs and linear-phase EQs.
  
One of the most popular equalization plugins in MAudioPlugins is MAutoDynamicEq. This is a smart and flexible equalizer that can automatically adjust its parameters based on the input signal. It has up to 16 bands that can be freely placed on the frequency spectrum and adjusted with various shapes and modes. You can also use the analyzer and sonogram features to visualize the frequency response and dynamics of your signal. MAutoDynamicEq has a unique feature called Auto gain compensation, which automatically adjusts the output gain to match the input gain. This makes it easier to compare different EQ settings without changing the perceived loudness.
  
Another great equalization plugin in MAudioPlugins is MFreeformAnalogEq. This is a creative and intuitive equalizer that lets you draw your own frequency response with your mouse. You can create any shape you want with up to 36 nodes and smooth or sharp curves. You can also use the presets or the randomizer features to get some inspiration or start from scratch. MFreeformAnalogEq has a unique feature called Analog emulation, which adds subtle harmonic distortion and noise to your sound to emulate analog hardware.
