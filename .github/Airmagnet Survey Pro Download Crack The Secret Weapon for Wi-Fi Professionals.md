Wi-Fi 6 is the latest generation of wireless technology that promises faster speeds, higher capacity, and lower latency. But how can you ensure that your Wi-Fi 6 network delivers the best performance and coverage for your users and devices?
 
One of the most important steps is to conduct a proper Wi-Fi design and site survey analysis using a professional tool like AirMagnet Survey PRO. This software enables you to plan, deploy, and validate Wi-Fi 6 networks for optimal performance, security, and compliance. It also helps you to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during or after the deployment.

In this article, we will show you how to use AirMagnet Survey PRO to design and deploy Wi-Fi 6 networks in indoor and outdoor environments.
 
## What is AirMagnet Survey PRO?
 
AirMagnet Survey PRO is a Wi-Fi design and site survey analysis solution that enables users to measure and assess the true end-user experience of a Wi-Fi 6 network using AirMapperâ¢ Site Survey on the AirCheckâ¢ G3 and EtherScopeâ¢ nXG. It goes beyond just verifying RF coverage by plotting actual end-user network performance in terms of throughput, data rates, SNR, interference, and more on the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. It also shows the coverage of specific Wi-Fi parameters that boost performance, such as higher MCS schemes and wider channels.
 
AirMagnet Survey PRO allows you to predictively model Wi-Fi 6 network changes or design a new network without physically rolling out APs. You can also collect real-world data by performing true end-user experience measurements using AirMapper Site Survey on the AirCheck G3 and EtherScope nXG. You can then generate heatmaps and reports that provide full visibility of WLAN coverage, noise, SNR, interference, throughput, data rates, retries, loss, and more on the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands.

AirMagnet Survey PRO is compatible with Wi-Fi 6E internal or USB based adapters. It also supports multi-floor deployments, GPS-based outdoor surveys, voice over Wi-Fi surveys, spectrum analysis surveys, iPerf surveys, multi-adapter surveys, passive surveys, active surveys, hybrid surveys, pre-deployment surveys, post-deployment surveys, AP on a stick surveys, and more.
 
## How to Design a Wi-Fi 6 Network with AirMagnet Survey PRO?
 
To design a Wi-Fi 6 network with AirMagnet Survey PRO, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new project and import your floor plan or map.
2. Define your project settings such as units, scale, orientation, building materials, etc.
3. Define your network requirements such as target devices, applications, coverage areas, signal strength thresholds, etc.
4. Select your AP model and antenna type from the built-in database or create your own custom AP profile.
5. Use the Auto-Planner tool to automatically place APs on the floor plan based on your network requirements. You can also manually place or adjust APs as needed.
6. Use the Coverage tool to visualize the predicted RF coverage of your APs on different parameters such as signal strength, SNR, data rate, channel overlap, etc.
7. Use the Performance tool to visualize the predicted end-user performance of your APs on different parameters such as throughput, packet loss, latency, jitter, etc.
8. Use the Capacity tool to estimate the number of concurrent users and devices that can be supported by your APs based on their bandwidth consumption and airtime utilization.
9. Use the Interference tool to identify potential sources of interference from other Wi-Fi networks or non-Wi-Fi devices on your floor plan.
10. Use the Report tool to generate professional reports that summarize your network design and show various heatmaps and statistics.
