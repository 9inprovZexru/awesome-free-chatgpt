AutoCAD Civil 3D 2008 is a powerful software for civil engineering design and documentation. It allows you to create, edit, and analyze 3D models of terrain, roads, bridges, pipelines, and more. However, to use this software, you need to activate it with a valid serial number and activation code.
 
A keygen is a program that can generate these codes for you. However, using a keygen is illegal and risky, as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your data. Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen to activate AutoCAD Civil 3D 2008.

## What are the features of AutoCAD Civil 3D 2008?
 
AutoCAD Civil 3D 2008 is not just a software for creating 3D models. It also has many features that can help you design, analyze, and document your civil engineering projects. Some of these features are:

- **Multiuser Project Environment:** You can work collaboratively with other team members on the same project using either Autodesk Vault or data shortcuts. This way, you can share and update data across different drawings and documents, and generate corridor sections through external references[^1^].
- **Plans Production:** You can automate the generation of roadway plan, profile, and plan/profile sheets using a wizard that is integrated with AutoCAD Sheet Set Manager and Autodesk Vault. You can also create split profile views that remain dynamic to the model[^1^].
- **Production Drafting:** You can improve your drafting quality and efficiency with enhancements to profile and section plotting and annotation, grading feature line label improvements, new contour label creation interface, and more[^1^].
- **Survey:** You can use new utilities to create base geometry faster from field-captured data. You can also use third-party applications from equipment manufacturers to move your design model into the field for machine control-based construction[^1^].
- **Grading:** You can use a broad set of tools for creating and modifying 3D geometry, such as feature lines, 3D polylines, 2D polylines, and lot lines. You can also calculate feature line statistics, such as linear total[^1^].

These are just some of the features of AutoCAD Civil 3D 2008. To learn more about this software, you can visit Autodesk's website[^2^] or watch some tutorials on YouTube.
