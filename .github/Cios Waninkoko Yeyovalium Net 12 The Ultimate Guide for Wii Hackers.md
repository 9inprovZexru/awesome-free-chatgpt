Cios Waninkoko Yeyovalium Net 12 is a custom IOS (cIOS) for the Nintendo Wii console that allows you to run homebrew applications and games from a USB device or an SD card. It is based on the cIOS of Waninkoko, a well-known Wii hacker and developer, who created the first cIOS for the Wii back in 2008.

A cIOS is a modified version of the official IOS (Input/Output System) that runs on the Wii. The IOS is responsible for managing the hardware and software of the console, such as the disc drive, the Wi-Fi, the USB ports, etc. The official IOS has some limitations and restrictions that prevent users from running unofficial software or accessing certain features. For example, the official IOS does not support USB loading, which means you cannot play games from a USB device or backup your discs to a hard drive.
  
By installing a cIOS, you can bypass these limitations and unlock the full potential of your Wii. You can run homebrew applications and games that are not authorized by Nintendo, such as emulators, media players, backup loaders, etc. You can also access features that are not available on the official IOS, such as region-free gaming, online updates, NAND emulation, etc.
  
Cios Waninkoko Yeyovalium Net 12 is one of the most popular and stable cIOS for the Wii. It is compatible with most homebrew applications and games, and it supports various USB devices and SD cards. It also has some unique features, such as:
  
- Yeyovalium: A custom module that enhances the performance and stability of the cIOS.
- Net 12: A network module that allows you to download updates and patches for the cIOS directly from the internet.
- Slot selection: You can install the cIOS in any slot you want, from 200 to 255. This gives you more flexibility and compatibility with other cIOS.
