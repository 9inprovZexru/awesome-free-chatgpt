# How to Fix Codename: Panzers - Cold War Lag Issues on Windows 10
 
Codename: Panzers - Cold War is a real-time strategy game that was released in 2009 by Atari and Innoglow. The game is set in an alternate history scenario where the Cold War turned into a hot war after a plane crash in Berlin in 1949. The game features a single-player campaign, a co-op mode, and a multiplayer mode with various scenarios and maps.
 
However, some players have reported that the game suffers from lag issues on Windows 10, especially when it comes to the units' movements and the in-game movies. The game seems to run smoothly when scrolling the map, but the units appear choppy and stuttering. This can affect the gameplay experience and make it frustrating to play.

## How to Play Codename: Panzers - Cold War Effectively
 
If you have fixed the lag issues on Windows 10 and want to play Codename: Panzers - Cold War more effectively, here are some gameplay tips that might help you:

- Learn the basics of the game. The game has a basic tutorial that teaches you how to control your units, use your abilities, capture points, build structures, and more. You can access it from the main menu or watch it on YouTube[^2^]. It is recommended that you complete the tutorial before starting the campaign or playing online.
- Choose your faction wisely. The game has two factions: NATO and Soviet. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as different units, abilities, and strategies. For example, NATO has more advanced technology and air support, while Soviet has more powerful tanks and artillery. You should choose your faction based on your playstyle and preference.
- Use cover and terrain to your advantage. The game has a realistic physics engine that simulates bullet trajectories, explosions, collisions, and more. This means that cover and terrain play an important role in combat. You should use buildings, trees, hills, bridges, and other objects to protect your units from enemy fire and ambushes. You should also avoid exposing your units to open fields or roads where they can be easily targeted.
- Manage your resources carefully. The game has three resources: prestige points (PP), supply points (SP), and fuel points (FP). PP are used to buy new units and abilities, SP are used to repair and resupply your units, and FP are used to move your units around the map. You should balance your spending of these resources and avoid wasting them on unnecessary 8cf37b1e13
