Planet Terror is a 2007 American horror film written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. It is one of two feature-length segments of the double feature Grindhouse, along with Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. The film follows a group of people who try to survive an outbreak of a deadly virus that turns people into zombie-like creatures.
 
The film was released in theaters with a fake trailer for a sequel called Machete, which later became a real film starring Danny Trejo. Planet Terror was also released separately on DVD and Blu-ray, with different versions available for different regions. One of these versions is a dual audio option that allows viewers to choose between English and Hindi languages.
