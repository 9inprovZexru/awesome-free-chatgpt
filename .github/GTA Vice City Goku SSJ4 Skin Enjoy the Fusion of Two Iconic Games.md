If you are a fan of both GTA Vice City and Dragon Ball Z, you might have wondered how to play as Goku, the legendary Saiyan warrior, in the game. Well, wonder no more, because there is a mod that lets you do just that. In this article, we will show you how to install and use the mod that transforms your character into Goku SSJ4, the ultimate form of Super Saiyan.
 
The mod we are talking about is called **Ultra Goku**, created by Aymen.2002. It replaces the default player model with a high-quality model of Goku SSJ4, complete with movable skeleton and arms. You can also use different outfits and hairstyles for Goku, such as SS Blue or normal black hair. The mod also adds some sound effects and animations from Dragon Ball Z, such as flying, charging ki, and firing energy blasts.

To install the mod, you will need to download it from [GTAinside.com](https://www.gtainside.com/en/vicecity/skins/182541-ultra-goku/), where you can also find screenshots and videos of the mod in action. The download link is at the bottom of the page. Once you have downloaded the mod, you will need to extract the files using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will see a folder called *Ultra Goku*, which contains two subfolders: *models* and *audio*.
 
The next step is to copy the files from the *models* folder to your GTA Vice City game directory, which is usually located at `C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto Vice City`. You will need to overwrite the existing files, so make sure you have a backup of your original files in case something goes wrong. The files you need to copy are `player.dff`, `player.txd`, and `gta3.img`.
 
The final step is to copy the files from the *audio* folder to your GTA Vice City game directory as well. These files are `sfx.SDT` and `sfx.RAW`, which contain the sound effects and voice clips for Goku. Again, make sure you have a backup of your original files before overwriting them.
 
Now you are ready to play as Goku SSJ4 in GTA Vice City. To activate the mod, you just need to start a new game or load an existing save file. You will see that your character has changed into Goku SSJ4, with his trademark red fur and yellow hair. You can also change his outfit and hairstyle by using a clothes shop or a barber shop in the game. To use his special abilities, such as flying or firing energy blasts, you will need to press certain keys on your keyboard or buttons on your controller. You can find the instructions for these keys or buttons on the mod page on GTAinside.com.
 
We hope you enjoy playing as Goku SSJ4 in GTA Vice City. Have fun exploring the city and fighting enemies with your superpowers. Just be careful not to cause too much chaos or attract too much attention from the police. Remember, this is still GTA Vice City, not Dragon Ball Z.
